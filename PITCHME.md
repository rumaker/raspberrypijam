## What's a Raspberry PI Jam?

> A Raspberry Jam is the pun-tastic name we give to a meetup of people interested in making things with a Raspberry Pi computer. Raspberry Jams come in all shapes and sizes: workshops for beginners, drop-in sessions to work on your own projects, show-and-tell, talks, and more. A Jam is a meeting of all kinds of people: some will be new to physical computing, and some will have plenty of experience that they are happy to share. Jams are welcoming events where youâ€™ll meet and learn from like-minded people in a friendly environment.
